<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>The dependent sheet or cascading style sheet (English: Cascading Style Sheet) is a style language (English: Style sheet language) that describes[*][1] how the markup language is actually displayed, mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and is also available in XML.It is the standard of W3C and has a high degree of freedom when defining layout and style.The default file[2] name is style.css.

    If the markup language (ex: HTML) is in charge of the body of the website, CSS is in charge of decorating clothes and accessories.In other words, you can decorate it like a completely different website by just changing the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure intact.
    
    In the case of CSS3, which is currently being developed, the ability to replace images produced by graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradations, and variations has been added.In addition, various animation functions have been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.</p>
